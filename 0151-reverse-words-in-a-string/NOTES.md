* We can solve this question using tokeninzer by using string stream function
* This takes word and removes spaces by default. Then we can append those words in string
â€‹
* We can also use 2 pointer technique
* Initially we will reverse complete string.
* In this technique we will maintain 2 pointers l ,r and i. l,r denotes the word to be reversed and 'i' will keep track of spaces and occuring characters.
